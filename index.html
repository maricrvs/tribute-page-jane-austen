           <h4 class="biography-text">Jane Austen, (born December 16, 1775, 
            Steventon, Hampshire, England — died July 18, 
             1817, Winchester, Hampshire), was an English writer 
             who first gave the novel its distinctly modern 
             character through her treatment of ordinary 
             people in everyday life. She published four 
             novels during her lifetime: Sense and Sensibility 
             (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield 
             Park (1814), and Emma (1815). In these and in 
             Persuasion and Northanger Abbey (published 
             together posthumously, 1817), she vividly 
             depicted English middle-class life during the 
             early 19th century. Her novels defined the era’s 
             novel of manners, but they also became 
             timeless classics that remained critical and 
             popular successes for over two centuries 
             after her death.
